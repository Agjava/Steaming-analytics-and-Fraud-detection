**Fraud Detection**
The "Fraud" Detection
The fraud detection here is rule-based (simple but effective for demonstration):

Impossible Score Gains: Scores > 45 in a single event indicate potential cheating/exploits
Kill Rate Anomalies: Flagged at 2% probability to simulate detection of aim-bots or auto-kill hacks
Win Rate Anomalies: Excessive wins suggest match-fixing or exploitation
